# ASCII Blob

ASCII Blob is an interactive canvas experiment where ASCII symbols move and react to mouse interactions, creating fluid blob-like animations. Users can switch between different modes, trigger explosions, and adjust various visual parameters.

## Features

- **Modes**: Switch between Normal, Vortex, and Magnet modes by clicking.
- **Explosions**: Right-click to trigger an ASCII explosion at the cursor.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Use the sliders to change density, cursor size, blob speed, symbol size, and visual effects like swirl, bounce, and wave.

## Controls

- **Left-click**: Cycle through modes (Normal, Vortex, Magnet).
- **Right-click**: Trigger an ASCII explosion at the current cursor position.
- **Scroll**: Adjust vortex strength when in Vortex mode.

## Adjustable Settings

You can modify the following settings using sliders in the interface:

- **Density**: Control the number of symbols in the blob.
- **Cursor Size**: Change the area of effect around the mouse.
- **Blob Speed**: Set the fluidity and movement speed of the ASCII blob.
- **Symbol Size**: Adjust the size of the ASCII characters.
- **Swirl Effect**: Increase or decrease the swirl rotation speed.
- **Bounce Effect**: Control how symbols react when they move away from the cursor.
- **Wave Effect**: Add a wave-like oscillation to the movement.
